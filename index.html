        Have you participated in previous Computing Club activities, and experienced first hand the great synergy running
        through the organisers, as well as with the participants? Do you see great experience, potential and passion in
        yourself, which can be put into use to further the cause of your fellow faculty-mates?
      </p>
      <p>
        As students of SoC, we have reaped much benefits from the efforts of the previous Computing Club Management Committees.
        Heed the calling to contribute, to serve and to lead. Step up, present yourself to your fellow students, and take up
